    HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the fundamental language used for creating and structuring content on the web. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991, HTML uses a system of tags to define elements within a document, which web browsers then interpret to render web pages visually. An HTML document typically consists of a doctype declaration, and root <html> element containing a <head> section for meta-information like the title and links to stylesheets or scripts, and a <body> section where the actual content resides. Over the years, HTML has evolved through several versions, with HTML5 being the latest major update that introduced new features to support modern web applications, multimedia, and enhanced semantic structuring. Common HTML elements include those for text formatting (e.g., paragraphs, headings, links), images, lists, and forms, which together allow developers to create rich and interactive web experiences.

    CSS was proposed by HÃ¥kon Wium Lie in 1994 while working with Tim Berners-Lee at CERN. The first CSS specification (CSS1) was officially released by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. Since then, CSS has undergone several significant updates, each bringing more capabilities and refinements to the language. CSS2, released in 1998, introduced new features like positioning, z-index, and media types. The most recent version, CSS3, has been modularized to allow for more rapid and independent development of different parts of the language. CSS3 includes advanced features such as animations, transitions, gradients, and flexible box layouts.
